The rest of the work of approving that file will be done by the designated approver of the organization.



## Manage Budget

Here you can handle your budget according to your company’s needs. You can allocate, deallocate or bulk allocate budget to your managers or departments. 



**ALLOCATE BUDGET**

In this particular section, as an HR admin, you will have the freedom to choose the person to whom you will allow a particular budget. This particular person will have the authority to further process and disburse the points for the employees who have received an award.

![Manage_budget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48199047/83220207-09ccca00-a190-11ea-8c0d-83c288c32dac.png)

If somehow you want to revert back the allocated budget from a manager or a team leader and disburse it to someone else, then you need not worry about it. Our deallocate budget option allows you to do that.
